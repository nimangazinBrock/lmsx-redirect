### Setup

Dependent libraries installed by running python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
A file named config.json based on the sample file
Note: this file contains sensitive information, and its file permissions should be set so that it is only readable by the user running this script (e.g. chmod 600 config.json)
Create the required tables by running the SQL scripts in schema/tables on the database being used either manually or using create_schema.py
